## Problem Statment

Creating such a social platform for university where you can post and join activities when you are feeling lonely and want to kill time. 

## User journey

-> After authentication, create or join available posts. 
-> Chat with the user to tell or ask about the location. 
-> Posts are anonymous in order to randomize and make the hangouts more fun.
-> Post will delete automatically at the ending time entered by the poster.

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
